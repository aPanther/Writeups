# Sanity Check
### Description
**Category:** Misc  
**Difficulty:** Baby  
**Author:** explo1t  

>We had minor issues launching the ctf platform and used the discord channel to meme about it. Join the discord and find the hidden flag in the announcement channel.

## Solution

**The only reason I am writing a writeup for sanity check is because I wanted to learn markdown.**    

Joining the discord server and looking in the  **#ank√ºndigungen** channel, _explo1t_ sent this photo(along with some message in german)

In the down-right corner we can see the flag.
