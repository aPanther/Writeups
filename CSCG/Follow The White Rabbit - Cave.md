## Solution
**Before we start, the way I used to solve this challenge is quite weird.**
We will use the tool _Cheat Engine_ to complete this challenge. Start the game, start cheat engine. Now we have change the z-coordinate of player's postion and keep scanning for the value in memory. When we finally find it, we have to change the value so that we are under the map. Now the only thing left to do is **roam**, until we find the flag.
